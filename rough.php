                        <p class=" mb-35">We were approached by a famous news channel in Bhubaneswar for a studio makeover,  for one of its morning dailies  called “Breakfast Odisha”. After understanding their requirements, we primarily did some cosmetic changes to give a different and contemporary look. In this project, we changed sticker on back side with some vibrant colours along with put some big and small cushions, and added few artefacts on the table to give  it a fresh look. The new look has been noticed and appreciated by the viewers.</p>

                        <p class=" mb-35">A senior interior designer from Odisha has asked us to develop this fabric for her client. She shared with us an image of the chair, along with only information that fabric should be soft. This particular design was difficult to develop as it is not clearly visible and there are 3 colours involved in it. Out of 3 options submitted to her, she has approved this one enclosed for her client. The fabric comes out to be perfect as we had used chenille fabric as base for softness as well as upholstery application.</p>

Initially we were little worried, as normally in Odisha we make light weight handloom fabrics for dress material and sarees,  but took the challenge and we specially developed this ikat fabric with small motif designs for her and were happy to surpass her expectations.</p>
